# Hunterrank

Hunterrank is a fantasy-themed forum for requesting and accepting bug-hunting quests.

## Description

Hunterrank provides a platform where customers—developers with bugs in their code—can post bug-hunting quests on the Guild's quest board which can later be accepted by hunters—other developers. Upon the successful completion of a quest, the hunter will receive the corresponding reward of that quest, in addition to that, multiple completion of different quests will level up the hunter, which in turn will unlock more quests with higher levels of difficulty.
